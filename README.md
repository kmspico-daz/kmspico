# About the KMSpico activator 

KMSpico is a free activator developed by the DazTeam team to activate Windows operating systems [11/10/8] as well as to activate Microsoft Office office programs [2021/2019/2016/2013/2011]. The utility is provided free of charge and as is. More often, the program is distributed in the archive for free movement. You can download the archive with the activator from the link below. The program is intended for general familiarization and the concept of how kms-type activation works.

## Recommendations for working with the KMSpico activator


To successfully launch the activator, you need to add the folder with the activator to the exceptions for antivirus programs. Otherwise, activation will not occur and the program will be deleted from your PC. Or the archive with the activator will be blocked. For successful activation, you do not need the Internet, as well as you do not need to call and confirm the serial number of your Windows operating system by phone. Please note that for successful operation, you should check the current activator before launching. On this page, the latest activation from TeamDaz is the KMSpico 11 utility.


## System requirements for running the kms activator

Many people are used to studying the system requirements for running certain programs, fearing that their computer will not be able to run a particular program. In this case, you should not worry. The activator works and runs on any PC (personal or mobile) where the Windows 7 and younger operating system is running. At the moment, it's hard to imagine a PC that might not run WIndows 7 or even Win 10 pro. We strongly recommend that you download an archiver in advance that can open RAR and ZIP archives. 

## Windows updates after activation

Many users often ask what to do with Windows updates after activation via KMSpico. I will immediately answer that this is not a problem! You should not worry about updates, they will not affect the new license of your operating system or Microsoft Office. After activation, you can also delete the activator and everything related to it. You can also upgrade Windows to a different version after activation and nothing will happen.

## KMSpico interface

The program is designed specifically with the expectation of a simple user. There is nothing complicated. A couple of buttons and that's it. Each button has a corresponding name. To activate Microsoft Office, click the appropriate button of the same name. It is worth considering that the program can store backups of the license, which can be restored after reinstalling the operating system. The Task scheduler editor is also available to you. You can set the activation interval that will take place via the kms server. You can also save backups of license keys to the cloud or to a flash drive. I concluded for myself that this is the best activator at the moment.

## Conditions for the distribution of the KMSpico program

This program is distributed completely free and freely. But it should be noted that it is forbidden to sell this product and use it for commercial purposes without the permission of the developer. You should understand that it is best to use this utility for personal educational purposes to visually understand how activation works through kms services. After you have studied the program, you should uninstall it and buy an official license. It may be expensive, but it will be the right decision.



## The conclusions we came to in the article

After you have read the article to the end, if you have read it, then I hope you have drawn conclusions for yourself that it is better to buy a license for Windows and for Microsoft Office in the official store. If you do not have this option, then downloading the KMSpico program may be a temporary solution. This activator does an excellent job with its tasks at the moment and can activate both Office And Windows at the same time. Regardless of the product versions. I hope the article turned out to be clear and simple, thank you for your attention. The link to download the program is at the beginning of the satya.
